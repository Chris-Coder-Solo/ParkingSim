# ParkingSim

ParkingSim is an interactive web-based parking lot simulation designed to demonstrate the dynamics of a busy parking area. This project showcases various programming concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, and simulation logic.

## Features

- Real-time simulation of a 12-spot parking lot
- Automatic hourly updates with random car arrivals
- Visual representation of occupied and free parking spots
- Blinking effects for arriving and departing cars
- Event logging system for tracking parking activities
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Demo

[Add a link to a live demo or a screenshot of your simulation here]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ParkingSim.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd ParkingSim
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. The simulation starts automatically when you load the page.
2. Each parking spot is represented by a square on the grid.
3. Green spots are occupied, while grey spots are available.
4. Yellow blinks indicate an arriving car, red blinks indicate a departing car.
5. The status display shows the current hour and number of arriving cars.
6. Use the "View Log" button to see recent events, such as cars unable to find parking.
